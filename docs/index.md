# KoboldAI

We are still constructing our website, for now you can find the following projects on their Github Pages!

[KoboldAI.net](https://koboldai.net) - Instant access to the KoboldAI Lite UI without the need to run the AI yourself!

[KoboldCpp](https://koboldai.org/cpp) - Run GGUF models on your own PC using your favorite frontend (KoboldAI Lite included), OpenAI API compatible

[KoboldAI United](https://koboldai.org/united) - Need more than just GGUF or a UI more focussed on writing? KoboldAI United is for you.
